// Title comes from the workshop.yaml
// == Adding Triggers to the Pipeline

Most Git repository servers support the concept of web hooks -- calling to an
external source via HTTP(S) when a change in the code repository happens.
OpenShift provides an API endpoint that supports receiving hooks from
remote systems in order to trigger builds. By pointing the code repository's
hook at the OpenShift Pipelines resources, automated code/build/deploy pipelines can be achieved.

While Jenkins Pipelines were defined as *BuildConfig* with their webhook URLs, Tekton Pipelines have their own mechanism for that called *Trigger*.

Tekton link:https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers[Triggers] enable us to configure Pipelines to respond to external events (Git push events, pull requests etc) such as Web Hooks.

Adding triggering support requires the creation of a *TriggerTemplate*, *TriggerBinding*, and an *EventListener* in our project.

Examine see each component in detail:

* *TriggerTemplate*: a trigger template is a template for newly created resources. It supports parameters to create specific *PipelineResources* and *PipelineRuns*.
* *TriggerBinding*: validates events and extracts payload fields
* *EventListener*: connects *TriggerBindings* and *TriggerTemplates* into an addressable endpoint (the event sink). It uses the extracted event parameters from each TriggerBinding (and any supplied static parameters) to create the resources specified in the corresponding TriggerTemplate. It also optionally allows an external service to pre-process the event payload via the interceptor field.

Review our component that we can create either from Web Console than command line:

[source,yaml,role=copypaste]

apiVersion: triggers.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: EventListener
metadata:
  name: petclinic
spec:
  serviceAccountName: pipeline
  triggers:
  - bindings:
    - name: petclinic
    template:
      name: petclinic
----

[source,yaml,role=copypaste]
----
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: EventListener
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: Triggers
    eventlistener: petclinic

spec:
  port:
    targetPort: 8080
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: el-petclinic
    weight: 100

Create all these objects using a provided YAML manifest:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-gpte-labs/rhtr2020_pipelines/master/workshop/content/tekton/triggers/petclinic-triggers.yaml -n pipeline-%guid%
----

You should see that a new Deployment for the *EventListener* `el-petclinic` has been created:
[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc get deployment -n pipeline-%guid%
----

Also from Web Console, you should see a new Deployment `el-petclinic`. From there, copy `el-petclinic` route that you will use to configure a Webhook in Gitea.

image::images/pipeline_eventlistener.png[Eventlistener]

You can also retrieve the route from the CLI:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc get route el-petclinic -n pipeline-%guid%
----

== Configure Webhook in Gitea

Once you copied the Route URL for the `EventListener`, go to %gitea_url% and access with your credentials *%ocp_username%* and *%gitea_password%*.

After you logged in successfully, navigate to the `spring-petclinic` repository. Then at the top right click on *Settings*, then click the *Webhooks* tab.

Click the blue *Add Webhook* button and select the *Gitea* webhook type.

Add:
- *Target URL*: the URL you copied from previously retrieved route to your event listener (make sure to use `http://` at the beginning of the URL)
- *HTTP Method*: POST
- *POST Content Type*: application/json
- *Secret*: leave it blank

Click on *Add Webhook*.

image::images/gitea_webhook.png[Gitea Webhook]

== Trigger it!

Change a file in the source code to automatically trigger your Pipeline.
From project home in Gitea, navigate to `spring-petclinic / src / main / resources / messages /` and edit `message.properties`.

Change `Line 1` from:

[source,text,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
welcome=Welcome
----

to:

[source,text,subs="{markup-in-source}", role=copypaste]
----
welcome=Welcome to RHTR!
----

Click *Commit Changes* to commit and push changes.

Now the EventListener should have been invoked through the Route that you setup as a Gitea Webhook and thus a new pipeline should have started.

You can verify it from CLI:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
tkn pipeline ls -n pipeline-%guid%
----

Get logs from the running pipeline, select latest one:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
tkn pipeline logs -n pipeline-%guid%
----

Or in the Web Console, from left-side menu click *Pipelines* and then *petclinic-pipeline* to see running *PipelineRuns*.

image::images/pipeline_successful.png[Pipeline successful]

When the Pipeline has completed successfully, verify the new changes from *pipeline-%guid%-dev* and *pipeline-%guid%-prod* projects, clicking on Routes showing your changes deployed.

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc get pod -n petclinic-%guid%-dev
----

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc get pod -n petclinic-%guid%-prod
----

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc get routes -n petclinic-%guid%-dev
----

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc get routes -n petclinic-%guid%-prod
----

You should see some some beautiful pets greeting you from RHTR! :)

== Summary

You have successfully converted a Pipeline from Jenkins to Tekton and learned what steps are necessary to do so. And you even added an automatic pipeline trigger for any change to the source code repository.

Congratulations! This completes this lab.
