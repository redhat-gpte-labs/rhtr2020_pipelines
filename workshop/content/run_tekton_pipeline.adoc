// Title comes from the workshop.yaml
// == Run the OpenShift Pipeline

In previous sections you created and verified the tasks and you created the Pipeline. Now you are ready to execute the pipeline.

== Run the Pipeline

You can start the converted Pipeline either from the %web_console_url%[Web Console], or from command line.

For both methods, you will need to provide input parameters:

- *APP_NAME*: name of app deployment, in our case `petclinic`
- *APP_GIT_URL*: git repository URL where to get source code
- *APP_GIT_REVISION*: branch name for git repo
- *APP_IMAGE_STREAM*: the name of the ImageStream with tag for the app
- *DEV_NAMESPACE*: name of target project representing the Dev environment for the app
- *PROD_NAMESPACE*: name of target project representing the Prod environment for the app, where to promote it.

=== Run in the Web Console

. From the Developer Perspective again open `petclinic-pipeline` Pipeline and click on top-right *Actions* drop down list. Then click on *Start*.

. Inside *Workspaces* section, select from *app-source* drop down list *PVC*, then select *app-source-pvc*.
+
Leave the default of *Empty Directory* for *maven-settings* since you don't need to provide any custom Maven setting.

. Click the blue *Start* button to run the Pipeline.
+

. Follow execution and logs by clicking on active or executed Tasks:
+
image::images/pipeline_run.png[Pipeline Running]

. You can also follow the logs from the terminal with `tkn`:
+
[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
tkn pipeline logs -f
----

=== Run using the tkn CLI

You can run the Pipeline directly and watch the logs using the `tkn` CLI:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
tkn pipeline start petclinic-pipeline  \
    --use-param-defaults  \
    -w name=app-source,claimName=app-source-pvc \
    -w name=maven-settings,emptyDir= \
    --showlog \
    -n pipeline-%guid%
----

[NOTE]
In this example you just use the default parameters that the pipeline defined. You could of course specify your own parameters if required.

== Access the Application

image::images/pipeline_successful.png[Pipeline Successful]

If the pipeline was successful, then an image has been pushed into the `pipeline-%guid%-dev` project and a new deployment has been performed. Then the image has been tagged for _prod_ and deployed to `pipeline-%guid%-prod`.

. Validate that the application is running in the Development project:
+
[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc get pod -n petclinic-%guid%-dev
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
NAME                 READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
petclinic-1-c77xt    1/1     Running     0          17m
petclinic-1-deploy   0/1     Completed   0          17m
----

. Find the route for the application in your development project:
+
[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc get route -n petclinic-%guid%-dev
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,options="nowrap"]
----
NAME        HOST/PORT                                                                        PATH   SERVICES    PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
petclinic   petclinic-petclinic-%guid%-dev.%CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%          petclinic   8080-tcp
               None
----

. Use the route (`petclinic-petclinic-%guid%-dev.%CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%` in the example above) in a web browser to validate that the application is working.
. Also check that the production application is working. First check that the pod is running in your production project (note that you will not see a build pod in this project - you only build the container image in the development project):
+
[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc get pod -n petclinic-%guid%-prod
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
NAME                 READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
petclinic-1-8nrnc    1/1     Running     0          21m
petclinic-1-deploy   0/1     Completed   0          21m
----

. Retrieve the route for the production application:
+
[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc get route -n petclinic-%guid%-prod
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,options="nowrap"]
----
NAME        HOST/PORT                                                                         PATH   SERVICES    PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
petclinic   petclinic-petclinic-%guid%-prod.%CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%          petclinic   8080-tcp
                None
----
. Then check that the production application is also running.
